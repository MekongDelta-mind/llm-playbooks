# LLM Playbooks


## Repository

### The `llm_playbooks` library

This library will contain material for the book 'Designing Large Language Model Applications', along with a collection of tools and utils for working with LLMs, that is used across our projects. Full version launching on July 1! Apologies for the delay and thank you for your patience.






### Pre-commit

For contributing to LLM Playbooks, we highly suggest installing the provided [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to help with code cleaning. Again, we suggest installing using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/):

```shell
pipx install pre-commit
```

Then, install the hooks by running

```shell
pre-commit install
```

from this directory.
